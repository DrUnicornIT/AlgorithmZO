# The 6 Most Important Keys to typing in Markdown
1. The link [[Tutorial Obsidian]]
2. The tag. Let's use #concept.
3. Italic. As you're typing and you want to *emphasize something* you add asterisks.
4. Bold. Typically, I'll use this when I want to bring attention to **Big Nouns**.
5. Lists.
6. Headers. (H1 to H6)
