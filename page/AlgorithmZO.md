## _Algorithm in competitive programming_
> In 2022, I have 4 years for coding by C++. In my high school, I'm one of the most good student in Vietnam. Reading, learning, coding and exploring are skills we need. I have a little list algorithm for everyone need.




| Algorithm | Used to |
|------|-----------|
| [Bruteforce](#Bruteforce) | Solving a problem that rely on sheer computing power|
| [[Binary search]] | Finding an item from a sorted list of items|
| [[Two pointer]] | Typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array| 
| [[Sorting]]| Rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements|
| [[Prefix sum]] | Fast calculation on the sum of elements in a given range|
| [[Linked list]] | A linear collection of data elements whose order is not give by their physical placement in memory |
| [[Knuth Morris Pratt]] | A substring search algorithm|
| [[Hash]] | A hash function that maps keys to some values|
| [[Keyword Tree]] | An extremely special and useful data-structure that are based on the _prefix of a string_|
| [[Range Minimum Query]] | Finding the minimal value in an array|
| [[Segment Tree]] | A data structure that allows answering range queries over an array effectively, while still being flexible enough to allow modifying the array.|
| [[Fenwick Tree]] | A data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate [prefix sums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum "Prefix sum") in a table of numbers|
| [[Heavy Light Decomposition]] | A fairly general technique that allows us to effectively solve many problems that come down to **queries on a tree**|
| [[Dynamic programming]] |  An algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem|
| [[DFS and BFS search ]] |  An algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures|
| [[Dijkstra]] |  An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph|
| [[Disjoint Set Union]] | A data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets
| [[Lowest Common Ancestor]] | Finding a least common ancestor|
| [[Euler and Hamiltonian]] | Euler and Hamiltonian|
| [[Ford–Fulkerson]]| Algorithm for Maximum Flow Problem|
| [[Two-Sat]] |  Assigning Boolean values to variables to satisfy a given Boolean formula|

## Bruteforce

## _My collections_
> My brotherhood is a pro developer. He recommended "You should have some collections, pet projects. The first benefit is ** advanced level ** . More importantly, having a few pet projects in your github account or CV will attest to employers that you are a ** tech enthusiast ** always looking to learn new things." So, I started when i was a student.
